# Word Mastermind

This game is a clone of [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/).
It's like the [MasterMind game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)), but instead of colors you have to guess words.

## Why?

The original game only allows one word per day. This one can be played endlessly.
Also, it's possible to fork it and configure it to work with a different dictionary/language.

## Demo

You can try it out [on Glitch](https://word-mastermind.glitch.me/).
